  <h1>Her Story..do you relate with her?</h1>
  <p>She would anticipate </p>
  <p>winning the race </p>
  <p>Where it starts</p>
  <p>is yet to chase</p>
  <p>questions to self are plenty, in the way</p>
  <p>It's a cycle to </p>
  <p>ask-start-stuck and start again.</p>
  <p>Destiny awaits her big and great</p>
  <p>the path is harder than hard, to what she aims</p>
  <p>Because Easy was never a choice she made.</p>

  <h1>A Lockdown day</h1>
  <p>Woke up at 12 ..yes 12 noon!</p>
  <p>It struck me again, even harder than it did yesterday</p>
  <p>The fear of piled up tasks , </p>
  <p>All undone </p>
  <p>It's a new day , a new start and I will get finished them all </p>
  <p>It will work ,it has to work.</p>
  <p>then unsee all .</p>
  <p>But there's no way.</p>
  <p>Done in few hours .</p>
  <p>Attend the class ,</p>
  <p>Can't get away. Alas!</p>
  <p>Sit on the table and </p>
  <p>Believe it.. I made it an hour.</p>
  <p>Phone rings , cousin ,pick up</p>
  <p>Back on table in few minutes</p>
  <p>with regretful thoughts over that shower.</p>
  <p>See the gloomy self to roast it up</p>
  <p>Couldn't find in  people around to judge</p>
  <p>Hence self is best to dig in </p>
  <p>but it's harsh</p>
  <p>Take a break , have some space </p>
  <p>Alright!will do the tasks  tomorrow.</p>
  <p>Shagged day</p>
  <p>as it was yesterday</p>
  <p>Would sleep at 2 am.</p>
  <p>Alarm rings ,it rings again </p>
  <p>I get up ,jump out of the bed </p>
  <p>Drink water ,head to my table </p>
  <p>Turn off the alarm and</p>
  <p>Sleep again.</p>
  <p>Finally up at noon, Miserable !!</p>
  <p>But tomorrow will be better</p>
  <p>Wait ..it's a long and an uncertain vacation .</p>

  <h1>Night</h1>

  <p>It doesn't begin after dusk</p>
  <p>It's relative</p>
  <p>Time of self help for somebody</p>
  <p>Hours of self-suspicion  for others</p>
  <p>It appears darker</p>
  <p>But no more creepy </p>
  <p>Only Makes feel lonelier</p>
  <p>Have we reached the culmination of hope?</p>
  <p>Or have the stars stopped to twinkle?</p>
  <p>Slide the curtains ,</p>
  <p>Skim the glass window </p>
  <p>Not think much</p>
  <p>and slumber again</p>
  <p>Be lost in sweet dreams</p>
  <p>Let's be up in the dawn</p>
  <p>Gaze upon the sunrise</p>
  <p>Breathe in again ,deeper</p>
  <p>This too ...shall pass.</p>
